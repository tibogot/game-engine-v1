# nam-rts — the list

Everything asked for or agreed in the build conversation (2026-09-18 → 22),
rebuilt from the full transcript. `[x]` done · `[ ]` open · `[~]` started or

## Now — the camp (your ask, 2026-09-22)

- [x] **Perimeter** (`campPerimeter.js`, on `?showcase=1`): earth **berm** raised
      into the terrain (`app.raiseBerm`), chain-link (+5 m), 2+1 concertina
      (+9 m) as a **nav barrier** — the gate is the only way in (verified with the
      pathfinder from S, W and E) — gate with guard booth and raised striped boom,
      guard towers on the south corners, floodlight masts, a power line up the
      road. Wire/fence/lights/power line are the v2 spline objects at 1.3x
- [ ] **Night / dusk lighting pass**: the map is midday, so lamps only glow;
      searchlight beams (fake volumetric cones), light pools on the ground,
      lamps tied to sun elevation — needs a dusk/night time of day to matter
- [ ] **String lights** — for the village / a club tent (v2 `stringLights.js`
      registered, not placed yet)
- [ ] Berm reads faintly on sand: a bare-earth look (dirt decals along it, or
      a paint layer) would make it pop from above
- [ ] Perimeter authored **in the editor** as splines instead of code (the
      objects already are editor spline types; needs a berm spline + barrier flag)
- [ ] Other camp dressing (suggestions): perimeter bunkers and fighting
      positions on the berm, claymores and trip flares with signs, helipad with
      PSP matting + windsock, generator shed, water trailer, shower tower,
      burn-barrel pit, jerry cans, ammo bunker, white-painted stones along roads
      (the whitewash surface exists)

## Props → a real part of the game

- [ ] Props into the **editor as placeable types**, each with: a declared
      footprint → flattened pad, **collision** (nav stamp from the real footprint,
      not the bounding box), **cover** bake, grass cleared under it, markings
- [ ] **See-through**: silhouettes for your hidden units (and spotted enemies
      only — concealment must still work), canopy dither around selected units /
      cursor, roof fade. Discussed, not built
- [ ] Camouflaged HQ-style buildings (the camo surface exists)
- [ ] **Enemy HQ** — still the old box. French colonial building taken over was
      liked
- [ ] **Village kit, built in the lab** as a modular kit, looking really good —
      incl. a small hut with a **big banana-leaf roof**; bamboo stilt house,
      granary, fences, jars, baskets, shrine, well, footbridge, sampan, fish
      traps, market stalls
- [ ] Battle debris: burnt jeep / truck / tank / Huey hulks, burnt hut, shell
      casings (hero pieces may be **your** Blender work)
- [ ] Nature/road extras: fallen logs, stumps, termite mounds
- [ ] More sign faces (propaganda boards, shop signs, tin ads, arrows)
- [ ] Kit bug: `rtsParts.buildSheetRoof` stands its sheets on edge (only the lab
      uses it)- [x] Quonset HQ with opening doors · US flag · guard tower · billboards (2/4
      posts) + sign sheet · MINES sign · gun pit, fuel dump, crate stack · GP tent
      + **medic tent** · Conex + yard · ISO container · radio station (kit) ·
      stencil markings (U.S. ARMY, red cross, codes) · camo surface · old
      container repainted · tank traps · z-fighting sweep + test
- [x] Buildings flatten a pad to their own footprint (race with River v2 fixed)

## Map & look

- [ ] **Birds** — cross the map in lines and leave (not the modular-road circles);
      **flushed from the canopy by explosions** as a "something's happening
      there" signal under fog of war. Engine already has a flock
      (`modularRoadBirds.js`, screen-size floor trick)
- [ ] **Grass coverage at zoom-out**: fade uses camera distance → zoom-driven
      tile/fade/width at a constant blade count (proposal). Cheap knobs first:
      Min width (px) ↑, Clumping ↑, Variation ↓, root shade
- [ ] **Foliage brightness** — **you**, taste call (knobs listed in the transcript)
- [ ] Rice paddies (expensive: water over big screen areas)
- [ ] A village as an *arrangement* (paths, well, fences, clearing)
- [ ] Pre-placed craters and wrecks (craterSystem exists)
- [ ] Telegraph poles along roads
- [ ] **Ocean** — off in the RTS; **you** are reworking Ocean v2 in another chat
- [ ] **River** — **you** are finishing/optimising River v2 in another chat;
      then river branches → **water units**, lily pads on the flow field
- [ ] Grass trails under units (`grassPush` exists)
- [ ] Texture repetition (hex tiling discussed; stochastic rejected — it swam)
- [ ] Napalm flame cores clip to white — per-fire intensity (taste)
- [ ] Octahedral impostors for the RTS camera — asked, never answered properly
- [x] New map, nav fix, flatter playable ground, terracing, bridges, beach
      (contour bands), rocks (palette, weathering, slabs, split boulders,
      megaliths, re-grounded), decal pass, monsoon fog, midday light + sky fill,
      unit/prop scale 1.3, revo grass, tall-plant field, foliage LOD from the RTS
      view, no grass on cliffs, labs on custom UI, fog of war off by default

## Gameplay

- [ ] **Enemy AI** — flanking, retreat, using terrain (biggest gap; you said
      "not now")
- [ ] Suppression / pinning · squads · armour matchups · high-ground bonus ·
      retreat · garrisoning · veterancy · win conditions beyond "destroy HQ"
- [ ] **Napalm aftermath** — `burnedAt` → vegetation/grass density, burnt
      ground, stumps, haze (burned ground = no concealment)
- [ ] Nav from vegetation (bamboo blocks, ferns don't) + river **fords**
- [ ] Pink/violet smoke on **capture points** — the M18 violet kind exists;
      capture points to trigger it
- [ ] Two factions in `unitTypes` · Vietnam units (Huey, M113, PBR) — **you**
      build the units
- [ ] Waves stay an optional mode only
- [x] Fixed 60 Hz sim · smoke that blocks sight · fire · napalm · abilities ·
      cover (directional) & concealment · spatial grid (300 units linear) ·
      stress price list

## Presentation

- [ ] **Audio** (`howler` installed, unused — you said "not now")
- [ ] Better **UI**
- [ ] Better **FX** pass (still rts-v3's look; never touch games/rts-v3)
- [ ] **Smoke look** fine-tune — **you**, later
- [ ] Unit responses · minimap pings / attack alerts

## Performance

- [ ] RTS camera render budget: sky dome (~0.5 ms), lens flare, underwater, far
      plane — off in RTS mode, back with C; measure each first
- [ ] Staggered target acquisition — **your** call (changes reaction timing)
- [ ] Terrain index blending (top-4 layers/texel), ~1 ms — engine, new chat
- [ ] The 10 ms hilltop GPU spot (parked)
- [x] River culling, foliage zoom thinning + no popping, layer budget, lean
      terrain, smoke cap, grass on/off switch in the dev panel

## Debt

- [ ] Prop nav stamps use the bounding box (units stop short of rocks)
- [ ] `cityKitTest` flaky under load
- [ ] Per-layer `auto` paint rules are dead state
- [ ] Passability overlay in the editor (see the nav map while sculpting)
